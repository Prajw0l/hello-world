  <p> let me explain to you about the time I wrestled a bear. dude it was a 500lbs and 8ft tall. i was on the wild hunting some elk. They out of nowhere this giant mosnter starts rushing towards me and I started looking through my stuff for a bear spray or a gun. I was so out of my nerves that by hand started shaking, I just could not find anything and the bear was already towering over me, I thought it was over. It pounced at me but I bobed and weeved, I kicked at it's hind legs and it didn't even feel it. so i started taking backcontrol. Thankgod I had some rope on me. I started poking it with my pocket knife and then I found a chance to poke the bear's eye and I had to take the chance, I took it poked it's eye. Then i ran away and lived.</p>
